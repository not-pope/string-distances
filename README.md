# Levenshtein distance
This is a repo with different implementations of levenshtein distance algorithm (currently just recursive one is here, but ill get back to this eventually)

## What is Levenshtein distance

Its a string metric for measuring 'distance' between two text sequences (strings). It calculates minimum number of single-character *edits* required to change one word (string) to another.
What are allowed *edits*?
1. insertion 
2. delition, and
3. substitution

Other versions of this problems (strings distance) have different constrains on what edits are.

The distance between two strings *a* and *b* is given by ![distance.png](/images/distance.png)
